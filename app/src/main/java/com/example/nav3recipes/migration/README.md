# Migration Recipe

This recipe accompanies the [migration guide](../../../../../../docs/MigratingFromNavigation2.md) and provides a practical, step-by-step example of migrating a multi-module Android application from Navigation 2 to Navigation 3.

Each package within this recipe (`start`, `step2`, etc.) corresponds to a stage in the migration process, allowing you to see the code at each step.
